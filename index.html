    The chart presents the average price from 5 different states that the dealership sold from in the used car data set
    <br>
    <br>
    The annotations that display the average price of each car makes for each car at different states in the US.
    <br> 
    <br>
    It can be observed that Illinois is the state that has the highest average cost when it comes to buying used cars
    Later on, in the upcoming slides, we shall see how this correlates with the type of car purchases that tend to be made by these 5 states
